# Note:
This is a revised version of the original script by Devil4angle. A few changes have been made to improve its performance in the early game:

- Boost has been disabled.
- Auto-buy has been changed from 50 to 10.
- Auto-buy timer has been changed from 10 minutes to 5 minutes.

# How to make it run?

(Works only with the Steam Version on Windows)

You have two options:

1) **Run with _.exe files** (easy):

    Go under [Github Releases](https://github.com/Devil4ngle/Idle_Slayer_Script/releases) and download `Idle Runner_x64.exe` or `Idle Runner_x32.exe` depending on your [System](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d). After that run it. Do not run it from the search bar.


2) **Run with source code** (harder):

    If you do not trust the .exe files or your antivirus won't let you run it. You can download the [Source Code](https://github.com/Devil4ngle/Idle_Slayer_Script/releases) and unzip it. After that download and install [AutoIt Full Installation and AutoIt Script Editor](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/).

    When Autoit is installed right-click the file `Idle Runner.au3` and click the option `Compile with Options` in the menu click `Compile Script`.
    It will generate .exe file which you can run.
